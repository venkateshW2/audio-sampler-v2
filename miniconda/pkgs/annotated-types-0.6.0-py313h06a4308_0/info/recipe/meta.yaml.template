  summary: Reusable constraint types to use with typing.Annotated
  description: |
    This package provides metadata objects which can be used to represent common constraints such as upper and lower
    bounds on scalar values and collection sizes, a Predicate marker for runtime checks, and descriptions of how we
    intend these metadata to be interpreted. In some cases, we also note alternative representations which do not
    require this package.
